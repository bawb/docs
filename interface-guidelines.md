## Interface Guidelines

While the OUYA platform is as open as possible, we realize that some semblance of structure can be a good thing.

Whether youâ€™re writing a new game exclusively for OUYA, or porting an existing one, your users will thank you if you take the time to engineer a seamless and intuitive experience!

```text
OUYA    Color    Default Function
O       green    select
U       blue     -
Y       yellow   -
A       red      back/cancel
```

Please use the naming conventions below when referring to the controller buttons in help screens for your game:
```text
O, U, Y, A
System (the home button)
D-Pad 
LS (the left joystick movement)
L1 (the left bumper)
L2 (the left trigger)
L3 (the button function of pressing the left joystick straight down)
RS
R1
R2
R3
Touchpad (not "Trackpad")
```

### TV Safe Area

Leave at least a 10% margin between your UI elements and the edge of the screen. This will help ensure that your content is visible across a wide range of TVs and settings.
